**KMSAuto: A Powerful Microsoft Product Activator**

KMSAuto is an automatic activator for Microsoft products like Windows and Office, utilizing the KMS (Key Management Service) protocol for activation without the need for a paid license. With a single click, KMSAuto activates office suites, client, and server operating systems using various methods. Additionally, the tool allows for the installation and removal of KMS services, automatic reactivation, and applying custom keys.

### Features of KMSAuto

KMSAuto provides several tools for administration, changing the OS edition, and managing keys for the following Microsoft products:

- **Windows Vista – 10, 11** (only VL – Volume License editions)
- **Windows Server 2008 – 2016**
- **Office 2010 – 2019**

Users have reported that while KMSAuto may struggle with Windows 7 Ultimate, it successfully activates Office 2021, although the developer (Ratiborus) has not officially confirmed this.

### Activation Modes of KMSAuto

KMSAuto operates in three primary modes, accessible through the “Main Window” tab:

- **Activation**: Automatically injects the necessary mechanisms to pass the authenticity check of operating systems or office programs. It sequentially applies available cracking methods until successful activation. The tool also displays information about the Windows/Office license, including the product name, version, ID, computer IP address, activation date, and reactivation period.
  
- **Manual Key Installation**: Allows users to manually input GVLK keys via a graphical interface, simplifying the process even for non-technical users. Installed keys can be removed or custom keys added.

- **Scheduler**: This mode sets up automatic reactivation tasks, with the default set to every 10 days (modifiable). This ensures that products remain activated despite periodic checks by Microsoft.

### Settings

The settings section of KMSAuto is designed for advanced users and includes features like:

- Adjusting KMS service parameters and ports.
- Restoring previously used IP addresses.
- Switching between available interface languages (Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese, and English).
- Installing or removing KMS services.

Logs can also be exported in xlsx format for further analysis, and activation methods can be customized or set to automatic for ease of use.

### Utilities Tab

KMSAuto offers various administrative tools for Windows through its "Utilities" tab:

- **Services**: Accesses the management of installed system services.
- **Scheduler**: Launches the tool to create and edit scheduled tasks.
- **User Accounts**: Allows the management of user profiles.
- **Event Viewer**: Displays the system's event logs.
- **System File Check**: Verifies the integrity of system files.

KMSAuto also allows changing the OS edition, which is particularly useful when a license key is purchased for one version of Windows but another version is in use. If any issues arise with Microsoft Office, the package can be fully uninstalled, including registry keys and licenses.
